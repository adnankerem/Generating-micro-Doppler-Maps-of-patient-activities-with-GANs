# Generating-micro-Doppler-Maps-of-patient-activities-with-Generative-Adversarial-Network-GANs-
 generation of realistic samples with GAN can reduce the amount  of real data to collect. With up-sampling, down-sampling, and the  activity function we have used in our GAN, we were able to create  micro-Doppler data that is similar to the micro-Doppler data we  had.
